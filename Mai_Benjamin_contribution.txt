3.) Worked on Introduction, Methods/Algorithms/Concepts part A for Lisp Snake,
     Input data for Experiments IV: Part A Lisp Snake, Results Part A: LISP Humans (Controls), and the LISP SDL2 references
4.) Created the Github for my group and accepted requests to merge

Anything that ends with lisp, I initially did but others made changes to them!
