pip# Python and LISP Snake
To run the LISP version of snake it is recommended to be running on Linux and follow the instructions for LISP Install.

## LISP
### Install
Install the prerequisites by running `apt-get install sbcl libsdl2-dev libffi-dev libffi6 libsdl2-ttf-2.0`.

Next install quick LISP with `curl -0 https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp` and run the file with sbcl using the 
command `sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp`. Once quicklisp is installed it is recommended to enable it at startup by running 
`(ql:add-to-init-file)` while in sbcl (enter sbcl by typing `sbcl`). Next use quicklisp to install sdl2 and opengl with
with the following commands: `(ql:quickload "sdl2")`, `(ql:quickload "sdl2-ttf")`, and `(ql:quickload "cl-opengl")`.

Navigate to directory of "snakege.lsp" in terminal.
Run command `sbcl --load ~/quicklisp/setup.lisp --load "snake.lsp"`.
Then, once in sbcl, run `(snake)`.

### Running Snake (genetic algorithm)

Navigate to directory of "snakege.lsp".
Run command `sbcl --load ~/quicklisp/setup.lisp --load "snakege.lsp"`.


## Python
### Install
All the following dependencies must be installed.
Install Python3 with `sudo apt-get install python3`.
